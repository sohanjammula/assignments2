    "\n",
    "In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a **projection** refers to the transformation of data points from their original high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional subspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "PCA aims to find a set of orthogonal axes (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in the data. When we project the data onto these principal components, we effectively reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.\n",
