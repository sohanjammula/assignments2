    "Resource Management: Opening a file consumes system resources such as file handles. If you don't close a file after using it, \n",

    "which can lead to performance issues or even program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: When you write data to a file, it's typically buffered in memory until the file is closed or flushed. Closing \n",
    "the file ensures that any buffered data is written to disk, which helps to avoid potential data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Locking: Some operating systems may restrict access to a file while it's open. Closing the file releases any locks associated with it,\n",
    "allowing other processes or threads to access the file if needed.\n",
