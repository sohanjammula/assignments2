    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format to another, typically from human-readable format to \n",

    "Here's how data encoding is useful in data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing Categorical Data: In many real-world datasets, a significant portion of the data is categorical, meaning it \n",
    "    consists of labels or categories rather than numerical values. Before feeding this data into machine learning models, \n",
    "    it needs to be encoded into numerical format because most machine learning algorithms work with numerical data. Data \n",
    "    encoding techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding are used to convert categorical variables \n",
    "    into numerical representations.\n",
    "Feature Engineering: Data encoding is often a crucial part of feature engineering, where new features are created or existing \n",
    "    features are modified to improve the performance of machine learning models. By properly encoding categorical variables,\n",
    "    you can ensure that the models can effectively utilize the information contained in those variables.\n",
    "Improving Model Performance: Proper encoding of categorical variables can lead to better model performance. Choosing the right\n",
    "    encoding technique can help prevent issues such as bias or loss of information. For example, one-hot encoding ensures that\n",
    "    each category is represented by a separate binary feature, preventing the model from assuming any ordinal relationship \n",
    "    between categories.\n",
    "Interpretability: Data encoding can also enhance the interpretability of machine learning models. By encoding categorical \n",
    "    variables appropriately, you can preserve the semantic meaning of the categories, making it easier to interpret the model's\n",
    "    predictions and understand the factors driving those predictions.\n",
    "In summary, data encoding is a fundamental preprocessing step in data science that allows categorical data to be effectively\n",

    "    the dataset and avoids the curse of dimensionality, making the dataset more manageable for modeling.\n",
    "When the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy: One-hot encoding treats each category as independent of \n",
    "    others, which might not be suitable if there's an inherent order or hierarchy among the categories. Nominal encoding\n",
    "    preserves the ordinal relationship between categories, making it more appropriate in such situations.\n",
    "When computational resources are limited: One-hot encoding can lead to a sparse matrix representation, which consumes \n",
    "    more memory and computational resources, especially for large datasets with many unique categories. Nominal encoding \n",
    "    can be more memory-efficient since it directly maps categories to integer values without creating additional binary\n",
