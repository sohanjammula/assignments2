    "Lasso regression is particularly effective for high-dimensional datasets with many irrelevant features.\n",
    "Tree-Based Methods:\n",
    "Decision tree-based algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines) inherently perform feature selection during training.\n",
    "Features that contribute less to the overall decision-making process are pruned from the trees or given lower importance scores.\n",

    "ElasticNet can effectively select relevant features while mitigating overfitting.\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):\n",

    "Regularized Regression Models:\n",
    "Regularized regression models such as Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) and ElasticNet can be used for feature selection.\n",
    "These models penalize the magnitudes of the coefficients, which helps prevent overfitting and automatically selects relevant features during training.\n",

    "Limited by Statistical Measures: Filter methods rely on predefined statistical measures to assess the relevance of features to the target variable.\n",

    "to the best model performance.\n",
    "Difficulty in Handling Redundancy: Filter methods may select redundant features that provide similar information about the target variable.\n",
    "Redundant features can increase the complexity of the model without improving its predictive performance, leading to overfitting and decreased \n",
