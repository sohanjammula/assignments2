In essence, these are the data points that are most difficult to classify correctly or are close to the decision boundary, thus playing a significant role in determining the optimal hyperplane.\n",

These support vectors are the emails that lie closest to the decision boundary. They could be emails that are hard to classify or are located in regions where the classes overlap.\n",
