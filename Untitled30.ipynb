    "Independence: The observations should be independent of each other. In other words, the value of one observation should not be dependent on the value of another observation.\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the predictors. This means that the spread of the residuals should be consistent as the predictor variable changes.\n",
    "Normality of Residuals: The residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) should be normally distributed. This assumption is necessary for making inferences and conducting hypothesis tests.\n",

    "Residual Analysis: Plot the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) against the predicted values or against each predictor variable. Look for patterns in the residuals, such as non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.\n",

    "Homoscedasticity Tests: Perform tests like the Breusch-Pagan test or Goldfeld-Quandt test to check for homoscedasticity. Alternatively, scatter plots of residuals against predicted values can help visualize this assumption.\n",
    "Check for Multicollinearity: Calculate correlation coefficients between predictor variables. High correlation coefficients (close to 1 or -1) indicate potential multicollinearity issues. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) can also be calculated for each predictor variable to quantify the severity of multicollinearity.\n",
    "Durbin-Watson Test: This test assesses the independence of residuals. A value around 2 indicates no autocorrelation.\n",
    "Cook's Distance: This measures the influence of each observation on the regression coefficients. High values suggest influential data points that might be outliers or leverage points.\n",
